Dr. Aris Thorne founded Aetherian Dynamics after leaving a lucrative position at a major quantum computing firm. He became disillusioned with what he saw as a reckless "growth-at-all-costs" mentality in the tech industry. With a small team of like-minded scientists and engineers, he started Aetherian Dynamics with a modest inheritance and a powerful vision. The company's early years were focused on fundamental research in materials science. Thorne believed that the next great technological leap would not come from software alone, but from a deeper integration of the digital and physical realms. For nearly a decade, the company produced very few commercial products, instead publishing its research and building a portfolio of patents that it pledged to license at no cost for academic and non-commercial use. This approach earned it respect in the scientific community but little attention in the business world. That all changed in 2045 with the unveiling of its first major breakthrough.
