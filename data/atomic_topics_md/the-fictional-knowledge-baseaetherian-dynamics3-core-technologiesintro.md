Aetherian Dynamics is responsible for three transformative technologies that have had a profound impact on society. **Chrono-Weave Material** Chrono-Weave was the company's first revolutionary product. It is a programmable smart material composed of a matrix of nano-scale computational filaments. These filaments can alter their physical and chemical properties in response to electrical signals. This allows Chrono-Weave to change its color, texture, rigidity, and even its shape on command.
