The power of this technology also raised profound ethical concerns about mental privacy and cognitive freedom. Aetherian Dynamics took the unprecedented step of halting commercial sales of Synapse for two years while it spearheaded a global dialogue on its responsible use. This resulted in the "Synapse Accords," an international treaty that establishes strict data privacy rules for neural interfaces and enshrines the principle of "cognitive liberty." Aetherian Dynamics built the Accords' privacy protections directly into the hardware of the Synapse, making them impossible to bypass.
