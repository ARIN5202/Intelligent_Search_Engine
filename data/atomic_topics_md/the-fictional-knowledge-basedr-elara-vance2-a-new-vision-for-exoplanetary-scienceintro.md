After completing her doctorate, Dr. Vance joined the Sereleian Institute of Cosmic Studies. At the time, the search for extraterrestrial life (SETI) was dominated by the search for radio signals. Vance argued that this was too narrow an approach. She believed that life could exist in forms so different from our own that it might not use technology we would recognize. She proposed a new approach: the search for "anomalous complexity." Instead of looking for radio signals, she suggested looking for complex patterns in stellar data that could not be explained by known physics. She theorized that a sufficiently advanced form of life would, intentionally or not, leave a detectable mark on its environment—a "planetary-scale biosignature." Her ideas were initially met with skepticism by the international scientific community. But she was a persuasive advocate, and her deep knowledge and passion for her work won her the support of the Sereleian government. They agreed to fund her ambitious proposal: the construction of the Deep Reach Space Observatory.
