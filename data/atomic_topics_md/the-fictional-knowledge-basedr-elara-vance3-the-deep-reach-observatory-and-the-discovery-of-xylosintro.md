The Deep Reach Space Observatory, launched in 2075, was a marvel of Sereleian engineering. It was not just a powerful telescope; it was a sophisticated data analysis engine, designed specifically to hunt for the kind of anomalous complexity that Vance had described. For two years, the observatory scanned the skies, and Vance and her team sifted through the vast amounts of data. In 2077, their patience was rewarded. They found it: a faint, almost imperceptible pattern of light fluctuations from the star Kepler-186. It was this pattern that led them to the discovery of the planet Xylos and, eventually, to the detection of the light-based communication of the Luminoids. The discovery was a profound vindication of Vance's theories. It proved not only that life could exist in forms wildly different from our own, but also that her methods for detecting it were effective. She became an overnight celebrity, but she was a reluctant one, always deflecting praise to her team and to the Sereleian principles that had guided her work.
