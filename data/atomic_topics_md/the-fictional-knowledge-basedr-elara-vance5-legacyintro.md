Dr. Elara Vance passed away in 2120 at the age of 75, just as the Odyssey mission was reaching the midpoint of its journey to Xylos. She did not live to see if humanity would be able to establish a dialogue with the Luminoids, but her legacy was already secure. She is remembered as the person who expanded our definition of life and set a new standard for our conduct as we venture out into the cosmos. Her work was a testament to the power of a different way of thinking—one that blended scientific curiosity with a profound sense of humility and respect for the universe in all its complexity. The Sereleian principles she embodied have had a lasting impact on how humanity sees its place among the stars. ---
