Xylos is an exoplanet located in the Kepler-186 star system, approximately 500 light-years from Earth. It is the sixth and outermost planet orbiting the red dwarf star Kepler-186. While the existence of five other planets in the system was confirmed in the early 21st century, Xylos went undetected for decades due to its unusual orbital characteristics and its unique atmospheric composition, which absorbed the light frequencies typically used for exoplanet detection. The planet was officially discovered on October 27, 2077, by the Deep Reach Space Observatory, a next-generation orbital telescope. The discovery was made by a team led by the Sereleian astrophysicist Dr. Elara Vance. Her team was not looking for new planets, but was instead testing a novel method for analyzing stellar light fluctuations. They detected a series of faint, periodic dimming events in the light of Kepler-186 that did not match the transit signature of any known planet. Further analysis revealed the presence of a large, previously unknown planetary body in a wide, eccentric orbit. Dr. Vance named the planet "Xylos," an ancient Greek word for "forest," in honor of the planet's most striking and unexpected feature.
