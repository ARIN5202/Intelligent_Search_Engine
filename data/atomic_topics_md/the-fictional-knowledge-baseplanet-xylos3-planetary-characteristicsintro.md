Xylos is a world unlike any other yet discovered. It is classified as a "Super-Earth," but its geology and atmosphere are entirely unique. **Atmosphere and the "Auralight"** The atmosphere of Xylos is dense, with a surface pressure about three times that of Earth. It is primarily composed of argon (78%) and nitrogen (18%). The remaining 4% is a mix of trace gases, including a high concentration of a noble gas that has been named "Xenon-Phi." Xenon-Phi has a unique property: it is photosensitive. When struck by high-energy particles from stellar flares from Kepler-186, the gas ionizes and emits a brilliant, multi-colored light. Because of Xylos's dense atmosphere and strong magnetic field, this effect is not confined to the poles like Earth's auroras. Instead, it creates spectacular, planet-wide light shows that can last for several days. This phenomenon, known as the "Auralight," bathes the entire planet in shifting curtains of vibrant color. **Geology and the Crystalline Forests** The most astonishing feature of Xylos, and the reason for its name, is its surface. Initial spectral analysis indicated a surface rich in silicon. The first high-resolution images from the "Vance Mission" probe revealed that much of the planet's surface is covered in vast, continent-spanning structures that resemble forests. These are not forests of organic trees, however. They are composed of massive, intricate crystalline structures of silicon, some reaching heights of over a kilometer. These "Crystal Trees" are not static; they appear to grow, albeit at an incredibly slow rate. They are interconnected by a network of smaller crystalline filaments, forming a complex, planet-wide lattice. Beneath the surface, seismic data suggests the presence of a vast, subterranean ocean of liquid methane and ethane, kept liquid by the planet's internal geothermal heat.
