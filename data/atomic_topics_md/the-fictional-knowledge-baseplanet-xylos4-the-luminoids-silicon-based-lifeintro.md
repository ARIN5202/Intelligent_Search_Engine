For years after its discovery, Xylos was thought to be a fascinating but lifeless world. The extreme temperatures, high pressure, and lack of liquid water seemed to preclude the possibility of life as we know it. Dr. Elara Vance, however, hypothesized that the planet's unique conditions might support a form of life based on silicon rather than carbon. Her theory was confirmed in 2092 by the Vance Mission probe. The probe detected complex, organized patterns of light pulsing through the Crystalline Forests. These patterns were not random; they were a form of communication. Xylos is home to a form of silicon-based, crystalline life, which has been named the "Luminoids."
