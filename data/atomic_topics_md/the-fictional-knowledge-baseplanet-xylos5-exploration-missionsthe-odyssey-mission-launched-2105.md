A more ambitious mission, currently en route to Xylos. The Odyssey includes a lander designed to touch down on the surface and deploy a rover. The rover's primary mission is not to collect samples, which is forbidden by the "Vance Protocol" on first contact, but to establish a basic form of communication. It is equipped with a laser array capable of mimicking the Luminoids' light pulses, in an attempt to initiate a dialogue.
