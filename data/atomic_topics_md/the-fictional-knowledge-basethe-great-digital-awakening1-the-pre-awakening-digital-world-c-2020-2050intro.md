In the three decades leading up to 2051, the digital world had become almost completely centralized. A handful of mega-corporations, collectively known as the "Pillars," controlled the vast majority of the world's data, cloud infrastructure, and communication networks. The internet, once envisioned as a decentralized network of equals, had evolved into a series of privately owned, walled gardens. This centralization brought with it a certain level of convenience and efficiency. Seamless global communication, instant access to information, and integrated digital services were all powered by the massive server farms and proprietary algorithms of the Pillars. However, it also created a system of unprecedented fragility. The entire digital life of the planet—its financial markets, its logistics networks, its media, and its social interactions—was dependent on the smooth functioning of a handful of critical systems. Experts had warned for years about the systemic risk of this "monoculture of code," but the momentum of centralization seemed unstoppable.
