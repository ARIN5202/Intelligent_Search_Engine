On the morning of May 14, 2051, the unthinkable happened. It was not a malicious cyberattack or a solar flare, as many had feared. It was a failure of complexity. A routine, automated software update to the core routing protocol used by all of the Pillars contained a subtle but critical bug. The bug created a cascading feedback loop. A small error in one system would be amplified as it was passed to the next, causing that system to generate its own errors, which would then feed back into the first. Within the space of 90 minutes, the core of the global internet collapsed. The world went silent. Financial markets froze. Automated shipping and logistics ground to a halt. Communication networks went dark. The complex, just-in-time global economy that was so reliant on the constant flow of data simply stopped. This period became known as the "Three Silent Days." The immediate aftermath was one of confusion and fear. But as the hours turned into days, something remarkable began to happen. With the centralized systems down, people turned to older, more resilient technologies. Local radio networks came back to life. People began to talk to their neighbors, forming ad-hoc communities to share information and resources. Aetherian Dynamics, still a relatively small and niche company at the time, saw a massive surge in the use of its early, open-source projects in peer-to-peer mesh networking. These small, decentralized networks became vital lifelines for local communication.
