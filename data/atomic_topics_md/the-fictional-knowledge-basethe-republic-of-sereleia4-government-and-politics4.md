**Testing for Consensus:** The refined proposal is presented to the Council. Representatives are asked if they have any "fundamental objections"—reasons why they believe the proposal would violate the core principles of the Sereleian Covenant. If there are no fundamental objections, consensus is reached, and the proposal is adopted. If objections are raised, the process returns to the refinement stage.
