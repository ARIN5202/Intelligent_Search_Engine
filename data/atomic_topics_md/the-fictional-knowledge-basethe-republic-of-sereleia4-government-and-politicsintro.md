Sereleia's political system is a "Consensus Republic," a unique form of governance that operates without traditional political parties. **The Grand Council** The primary legislative body is the Grand Council, which consists of 300 representatives. Representatives are not elected in the conventional sense. Instead, they are selected through a process of civic lottery, known as the "Choosing," from a pool of eligible citizens who have put their names forward. To be eligible, a citizen must be over the age of 25 and have completed a mandatory course on Sereleian history, law, and the principles of consensus. Representatives serve a single four-year term and cannot serve again. This system is designed to prevent the formation of a professional political class and to ensure that the Grand Council is a true reflection of the Sereleian populace. **The Consensus Process** The most distinctive feature of Sereleian politics is its decision-making process. All major legislation requires the consensus of the Grand Council. This does not mean simple unanimity. The process is a structured form of deliberation that can take weeks or even months.
