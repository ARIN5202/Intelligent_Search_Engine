Sereleia's economy is a blend of high-tech innovation and sustainable principles. It consistently ranks among the highest in the world for GDP per capita, yet it has one of the lowest carbon footprints of any developed nation. **The Sereleian Model** The cornerstone of the economy is the "Sereleian Model" of corporate governance. The vast majority of Sereleian companies are structured as worker-owned cooperatives. This means that the employees of a company are also its primary shareholders. This model distributes profits more equitably and gives workers a direct say in the company's direction. It also fosters a strong sense of shared purpose and long-term thinking over short-term profit maximization. **Key Industries**
