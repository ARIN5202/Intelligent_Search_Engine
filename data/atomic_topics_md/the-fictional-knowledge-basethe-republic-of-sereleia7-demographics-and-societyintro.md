Sereleia is a highly egalitarian society with a strong social safety net. Education and healthcare are free and of a very high quality. The emphasis on community and consensus is reflected in low crime rates and high levels of social trust. The population is largely of Sereleian descent, but the country has been welcoming to immigrants who are willing to embrace its social model. The result is a small but growing multicultural community, particularly in the capital, Althaven. Life in Sereleia is often described as being slower-paced than in much of the rest of the world. There is a strong emphasis on work-life balance, connection with nature, and participation in community life. Sereleians are often characterized as being reserved but friendly, with a dry sense of humor and a deep sense of pride in their unique nation. ---
